    <h2>Early Life</h2>
<body>
    <p>
      I was born on November 9, 1995 at Michael Reese Hospital. I was raised on the southside of Chicago in
      the Clearing neighborhood.  My father, Paul, and my mother, Rita,work for the City's water department.
       I am the middle of three children. I attended St. Symphorosa Catholic grade school from Kindergarten to Eighth grade.

<h2> Highschool</h2>
<body>
<p>
I spent my first two years of highschool at Mount Carmel on Chicago's southside where I played baseball and soccer.
I was a member of video production club where I learned that I had a passion and talent for video editing.
It comes natural to me and I have since shot over 20 music videos for Chicagoland musicians. After my second year
at Mount Carmel my parents decided that the hour commute everyday was too much so I transferred to Nazareth Academy in Lagrange Park.

  <h3> College</h3>
  <body>
    <p>
      I accepted an offer to play baseball at Indiana Tech University in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I spent two years in Fort Wayne as a
      computer science major until I realized that I did not want to be a programmer anymore. I wanted to go into technology consulting
      and decided to transfer to Illinois Institute of Technology where I would major in Information, technology and management.
