    <h2>Athletics</h2>
    <p>
      I have been involved in athletics most of my life
      When I was 6 I joined my first organized sports team
      I have partaken in baseball, basketball, martial arts, and archery.
      I am a member of the men's baseball teach at Illinois Tech and was a member of
      a team at Indiana Tech that qualified for the college world series. Through sports I have
      learned discipline and the importance of time management.

<h2>The Great Outdoors</h2>
<body>
<p>
  In the summer months when I spend most of my freetime exploring what mother nature has to offer
Spending time outdoors gives me the opportunity to step back and escape the everyday life. Regardless
if I am out on my kayak fishing for bass or just walking through the woods, I am at peace when I am outdoors.
These hobbies include:
